# Awesome Robotics

This is a continuously updated list of Software, Libraries, Papers, Conferences, Competitions and other resources for robotics.

## Softwares and Libraries

[**ROS**](http://www.ros.org/) The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

[**MRPT**](http://www.mrpt.org/) Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit provides developers with portable and well-tested applications and libraries covering data structures and algorithms employed in common robotics research areas.

[**Robotics Library**](http://www.roboticslibrary.org/) The Robotics Library (RL) is a self-contained C++ library for robot kinematics, motion planning and control. It covers mathematics, kinematics and dynamics, hardware abstraction, motion planning, collision detection, and visualization.

[**Simbad**](http://simbad.sourceforge.net/) 2D/3D simulator in Java and Jython.

[**Morse**](https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse/) General purpose indoor/outdoor 3D simulator. (2020: Morse is now no longer updated)

[**Carmen**](http://carmen.sourceforge.net/) CARMEN is an open-source collection of software for mobile robot control. CARMEN is modular software designed to provide basic navigation primitives including: base and sensor control, logging, obstacle avoidance, localization, path planning, and mapping.

[**YARP**](http://www.yarp.it/) Yet Another Robot Platform.

[**V-REP**](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/) Robot simulator, 3D, source available, Lua scripting, APIs for C/C++, Python, Java, Matlab, URBI, 2 physics engines, full kinematic solver.

[**Webots**](https://cyberbotics.com/) Webots is a development environment used to model, program and simulate mobile robots.

[**Drake**](http://drake.mit.edu/) A planning, control and analysis toolbox for nonlinear dynamical systems.

[**Neurorobotics Platform (NRP)**](https://neurorobotics.net/) An Internet-accessible simulation system that allows the simulation of robots controlled by spiking neural networks.

[**The Player Project**](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/) Free Software tools for robot and sensor applications

[**ViSP**](http://visp.inria.fr/) Open-source visual servoing platform library, is able to compute control laws that can be applied to robotic systems.

[**g2core**](https://github.com/synthetos/g2) is a 9 axes (XYZABC+UVW) motion control system designed for high-performance on small to mid-sized machines..

[**ur5controller**](https://github.com/roboticsleeds/ur5controller) Open-source OpenRAVE controller for UR5 robot integrated with ROS.

[**RBDL**](https://github.com/rbdl/rbdl) Open-source (zlib) C++ libray for both forward and inverse dynamics and kinematics. Also supports contacts and loops.

[**Unity Robotics Hub**](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) Central repository for open-source Unity packages, tutorials, and other resources demonstrating how to use Unity for robotics simulations. Includes new support for ROS integration.

[**Gymnasium**](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) An API standard for reinforcement learning with a diverse collection of reference environments.
